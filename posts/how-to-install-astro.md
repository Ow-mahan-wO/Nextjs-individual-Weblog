# Install Astro manually

This guide will walk you through the steps to manually install and configure a new Astro project.

# Prerequisites

- Node.js - v18.14.1 or higher.
- Text editor - We recommend VS Code with our Official Astro extension.
- Terminal - Astro is accessed through its command-line interface (CLI).

# Installation

Section titled Installation
If you prefer not to use our automatic create astro CLI tool, you can set up your project yourself by following the guide below.

# 1.Create your directory

Section titled 1. Create your directory
Create an empty directory with the name of your project, and then navigate into it.

```npm
mkdir my-astro-project
cd my-astro-project

```

Once you are in your new directory, create your project package.json file. This is how you will manage your project dependencies, including Astro. If you arenâ€™t familiar with this file format, run the following command to create one.

```npm
npm init --yes
```

# 2.Install Astro

Section titled 2. Install Astro
First, install the Astro project dependencies inside your project.

```npm
npm install astro
```

# 3.Create your first page

Section titled 3. Create your first page
In your text editor, create a new file in your directory at 'src/pages/index.' astro. This will be your first Astro page in the project.

For this guide, copy-and-paste the following code snippet (including --- dashes) into your new file:

### src/pages/index.astro

```jsx
---
// Welcome to Astro! Everything between these triple-dash code fences
// is your "component frontmatter". It never runs in the browser.
console.log('This runs in your terminal, not the browser!');

---

<!-- Below is your "component template." It's just HTML, but with
     some magic sprinkled in to help you build great templates. -->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
<style>
  h1 {
    color: orange;
  }
</style>
```
